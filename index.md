# Welcome to Book a Book

Why buy a new book if you want to read it only once? Book a book is an online library for readers worldwide. It works based on a special membership. Moreover, you are given the possibility to exchange an old book for a new one! It is either a membership or an old book.

## The problem

Romanian editors are consistently complaining about the fact that the book market is very low, being placed the last in Europe, behind smaller countries like Hungary or the Czech Republic. Romanians neither buy nor read many books. In fact, these two are completely different things, although the polls show otherwise, considering the low number of visitors in public libraries. 

One of the reasons may be the things that people enjoy buying better than books. Time is another similar reason, as it is never enough, especially when buying books or reading are not on the top of the priorities list. 

## Book a book is a solution
Our idea represents a solution to these problems: an online library that enables any user to place him/herself only at a click away from a book ready to be read. The cost related issue may be solved by simply donating books for a monthly membership. As long as the membership is active, the user can borrow any book, and this will help our library grow. 

Another option for those who can not be apart from their books is to pay for the membership. For starters, we will promote the first option as much as possible because it serves our purpose: to grow the number and diversity of our books.

## Our target customers
“Books are a uniquely portable magic.” – Stephen King

Nowadays, the reading is either of electronic devices (mobile phones, e-readers, computer displays) or of the printed word from ink such as books, magazines or newspapers.

Book a Book is a project targeting people who have a passion for reading. The clients for this application are the people who wish to read but they don’t have time to go and search for the desired book and want to have the book delivered at their doors.
