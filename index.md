## The problem

Romanian editors are consistently complaining about the fact that the book market is very low, being placed the last in Europe, behind smaller countries like Hungary or the Czech Republic. Romanians neither buy nor read many books. In fact, these two are completely different things, although the polls show otherwise, considering the low number of visitors in public libraries. 

One of the reasons may be the things that people enjoy buying better than books. Time is another similar reason, as it is never enough, especially when buying books or reading are not on the top of the priorities list. 

## Book a Book is a solution 
Our idea represents a solution to these problems: an online library that enables any user to place him/herself only at a click away from a book ready to be read. 

The cost related issue may be solved by simply donating books for a monthly membership. As long as the membership is active, the user can borrow any book, and this will help our library grow. 

Another option for those who can not be apart from their books is to pay for the membership. For starters, we will promote the first option as much as possible because it serves our purpose: to grow the number and diversity of our books.


## Our target customers

Nowadays, the reading is either of electronic devices (mobile phones, e-readers, computer displays) or of the printed word from ink such as books, magazines or newspapers.

Book a Book is a project targeting people who have a passion for reading. The clients for this application are the people who wish to read but they don’t have time to go and search for the desired book and want to have the book delivered at their doors. 

## Our competition
The 3 big competitors for Book a Book are:
- [Booklender](https://www.booklender.com) who offers the possibility of renting a number of books for a membership paid monthly (the more expensive the membership the more number of books you can have at one time).
- [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) who offers the possibility of renting a book for a fixed price dependent on the desired book.
- [Bookster](https://www.bookster.ro) who is focused for the corporations, helping their employees to rent a book and have it at the company headquarters once a week.

## Why us ? Our advantage over the competition
In comparison with all these companies, Book a Book offers you the possibility to rent a book by having a monthly membership or by giving a book of your own and we will also bring the book to your door because we understand how important your time is.

## Key metrics 
- Daily, weekly, or monthly active users on application or website (DAU/WAU/MAU)

## Cost structure
Our startup has both variable and fixed costs.

In the fixed costs category we can find the salaries for our employees, the bank and legal charges, the software, the server and the domain name acquisition.

In the variable costs category we can identify the advertising and promotions, the delivery services of the books and the books replacement in case of destroying.

## Revenue streams 
In this company the revenue will come from 3 income streams:
- Monthly paid membership (which is the main income stream that we’ll have)
- Ads for the people which don’t have paid membership and are renting books by giving one in return(most ads we’ll be related with books and maybe some of them will be partnerships with some audio books websites).
