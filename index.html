								<h2 class="major">Milestone 1 - Description</h2>
								<h3>The problem</h3>
								<p>Romanian editors are consistently complaining about the fact that the book market is very low, being placed the last in Europe, behind smaller countries like Hungary or the Czech Republic. Romanians neither buy nor read many books. In fact, these two are completely different things, although the polls show otherwise, considering the low number of visitors in public libraries.
								<br>One of the reasons may be the things that people enjoy buying better than books. Time is another similar reason, as it is never enough, especially when buying books or reading are not on the top of the priorities list.</p>
							
								<h3>Book a Book is a solution</h3>
								<p>Our idea represents a solution to these problems: an online library that enables any user to place him/herself only at a click away from a book ready to be read.
								<br>The cost related issue may be solved by simply donating books for a monthly membership. As long as the membership is active, the user can borrow any book, and this will help our library grow.
								<br>Another option for those who can not be apart from their books is to pay for the membership. For starters, we will promote the first option as much as possible because it serves our purpose: to grow the number and diversity of our books.</p>	
								
								<h3>Our target customers</h3>
								<p>Nowadays, the reading is either of electronic devices (mobile phones, e-readers, computer displays) or of the printed word from ink such as books, magazines or newspapers.
								<br> Book a Book is a project targeting people who have a passion for reading. The clients for this application are the people who wish to read but they don’t have time to go and search for the desired book and want to have the book delivered at their doors.</p>
							
								<h3>Our competition</h3>
								The 3 big competitors for Book a Book are:
								<ul>
									<li> <a href="https://www.booklender.com/"> Booklender </a>who offers the possibility of renting a number of books for a membership paid monthly (the more expensive the membership the more number of books you can have at one time)</li>
									<li> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/"> Amazon </a> who offers the possibility of renting a book for a fixed price dependent on the desired book</li>
									<li> <a href="https://www.bookster.ro/landing/"> Bookster </a> who is focused for the corporations, helping their employees to rent a book and have it at the company headquarters once a week</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Why us ? Our advantage over the competition</h3>
								<p>In comparison with all these companies, Book a Book offers you the possibility to rent a book by having a monthly membership or by giving a book of your own and we will also bring the book to your door because we understand how important your time is.</p>
								
								<h3>Key metrics</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Daily, weekly, or monthly active users on application or website (DAU/WAU/MAU)</li>
									<li>Average time spent on your website</li>
									<li>Returning visitors to application or website</li>
									<li>User satisfaction</li>
									<li>Average revenue per account</li>
									<li>Number of logins</li>
									<li>Monthly recurring revenue</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Cost structure</h3>
								<p>Our startup has both variable and fixed costs.
								<br>In the fixed costs category we can find the salaries for our employees, the bank and legal charges, the software, the server and the domain name acquisition.
								<br>In the variable costs category we can identify the advertising and promotions, the delivery services of the books and the books replacement in case of destroying.
								</p>

								<h3>Revenue streams</h3>
								In this company the revenue will come from 3 income streams:
								<ul>
									<li>Monthly paid membership (which is the main income stream that we’ll have)</li>
									<li>Ads for the people which don’t have paid membership and are renting books by giving one in return(most ads we’ll be related with books and maybe some of them will be partnerships with some audio books websites)</li>
								</ul>

								<h2 class="major">Milestone 2 - Validation</h2>
								<h3>Identification of the problem</h3>
								<p> According to a <a href="https://pedagoteca.ro/studiu-jumatate-dintre-romani-nu-au-citit/"> study </a> from Romania, over half of the people in 2016 haven’t read any book. Knowledge is power: we believe that with our idea, people can be encouraged to improve themselves and read more.</p>
								
								<h3>Our solution</h3>
								<p>Considering all the possibilities that would have an impact on society, we thought of something innovative which would motivate people to improve themselves by reading. Taking into consideration our survey, most of them had a “time difficulty”. Book a Book can help the ones who don’t want to waste time by going to the library, searching for a book in stores or staying in queues to buy books. With our application, we believe that people would be more motivated to read more.</p>
							
								<h3>Our plan for customer discovery</h3>
								<p> We decided that we would gather our information from interviews and an online form. We wanted to reach a larger variety of people and we figured that an online form was the best and most efficient way to do it. We established a set of questions and then spread the form on multiple facebook groups and amongst some of our friends. In this way people of different ages and different domains of activity would fill it.</p>
								
								<h3>Description of the process</h3>
								<p>We collected information using online questionnaires and having face-to-face interviews. Over 160 people responded to our online survey and the age range of the ones who responded is between 18 and 53 years old. Even though 53 is the highest age that responded to our survey, talking face to face with some people over 58 who were kind enough to talk to us we discovered that they might be interested in our application. After the interviews, we realised that the application might interest a larger segment of people, the people who know how to browse the internet or who know own and know how to use a smartphone and like to read (probably not older that 65-70 years old).</p>
								Our <a href="https://kwiksurveys.com/s/DqFfeYSJ?fbclid=IwAR2AtMqjiWchE575R9xnE435df0DiMkFFKap-A_IdBNA2_qbarSOfWOQT2A#/0"> survey </a> questions were the following:
								<ul>
									<li>What age are you? (Write a number representing years)​</li>
									<li>Which is your professional field​?</li>
									<li>Do you read regularly?​​</li>
									<li>​How much do you read on average per week?​</li>
									<li>What kind of books do you enjoy reading?​</li>
									<li>What is your biggest setback when it comes to reading?​</li>
									<li>Do you think that having the possibility to exchange an old book of yours with a new one would help you read more often?​</li>
									<li>Do you have among your personal books some which you are willing to offer in exchange for a membership?​</li>
									<li>How much are you willing to pay on a monthly online library access which is also home delivering your books?​</li>								
								</ul>

								<h3>Description of how these insights affects our product</h3>
								<p>The next conclusions have been drawn from the <a href="https://kwiksurveys.com/r/NgmbJL7t?fbclid=IwAR2MtdYsVgpuUayeXlgeXDuD1Z1vA5iY97x5A9n0WxbagDYVEK6cM-3KR1Q"> form completed by over 160 people </a>:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>We can cover a vast segment including various ages, but this did not surprise us, considering that reading applies to any age. Taking into consideration the fact that young people are more active online than the others, we concluded that for now, we should focus on people that are not more than 30.</li>
									<img src="images/m2/age.png" width="100%" >
									<br>X axe - age, Y axe - number of users
									
									<li>Regarding the professional field, we have been glad to learn that our form have reached to people from various domains of activity. From our stats derives the observation that there are engineers, doctors, teachers, and students who have shown interest for an online library.</li>
									<img src="images/m2/occupation.png" width="100%">
									
									<li>76 % of the participants to this study have affirmed that they read on a daily basis, and 51 % have said they read 1 to 4 hours a week. This make us believe that there will be a continuum of borrowings monthly.</li>
									<img src="images/m2/read-week.png" width="100%">

									<li>Regarding the literary preferences, they vary and can be identified below.</li>
									<img src="images/m2/book-type.png" width="100%">

									<li>96 % said time is the greatest factor against reading. We believe that us delivering the books they like to the location of their choice will help them.</li>
									<img src="images/m2/setback.png" width="100%" >

									<li>We have also seen some sort of encouragement in the answers related to the idea of exchanging books. More than half of them think that a borrow- exchange type of activity would help them read more. 64% are willing to offer books for a monthly access, which makes us have faith in our idea.</li>
									<img src="images/m2/exchange-book.png" width="100%">

									<li>If 64 % of the participants to this study are willing to offer books in exchange for access, from our stats, the rest are willing to pay for it.</li>
									<img src="images/m2/pay-month.png" width="100%">
								</ol>

								<h3>Are we ready to move to the Customer Validation stage?</h3>
								<p>Taking into account the fact that 51% of the people who took the survey were willing to exchange an old book for a new one, 64% agreed to offering an old book for a membership and that 78% were willing to pay a monthly subscription, we think that we are ready to take this to the next step, Customer Validation.</p>
							
								<h3> Proof of the survey</h3>
								<p>The next photos are only a few of our work to make popular the survey.
								<br>
								We tried to contact people through Facebook groups, Facebook group/ personal messages and Whatsapp groups.

								1. 25 de ani<br>
								2. 7-8 ore<br>
								3. Da, am folosit. Îmi place pentru că e ușor și portabil și are lumină integrată. Dezavantajul este că având doar un număr care reprezintă procentajul rămas din carte, nu ai impresia că avansezi prin roman, așa cum ai când miști semnul de carte prin volum.<br>

									We promoted our page starting from 10 November and that is when we had a boost of users. After that, we noticed that the increase is not exponential because the views are from the posts we made it in the past. Then, on 23 November, we had another increase of views thanks to our Facebook page opening. You can see below the representation of our visits.<br>

									<p>Taking a look at the device categories, we can see that our users used both phones and computer devices, so this can tell us that BookaBook should be available for them both in order to attract users.</p>

									<p>Looking at the next picture, we can see that even though most of them are new, some of our users have returned in this period of time (including us :) ).</p>

									<p>Information from google analytics about user demographics and interests: 
											<br>As we predicted in our last survey, our users are the ones who browse the internet - age 18-54 years old, or more; but our most active users are between 18-34 years old.
											<br>Taking into consideration the interest categories of the people who visited our site, we can use the information to learn some of the topics for our first books acquisition.</p>
										
								<h4>2.3 Analyzing the traffic from Hotjar</h4>	
									<p>	Using Hotjar we managed to analyze the heatmaps for clicks, scroll or movement and see how users interact with the landing page.<br>
									Our potential users were interested in solution, the steps & contact section and the 'leave your contact' area.<br>
									Also, some people are clicking on elements that are not clickable, so our page in some sections might be causing confusion for visitors.
									<br>
									<a href="images/m5/heatmap-5019308-click-desktop.jpg" target="_blank">Click heatmap for desktop</a>
									<br>
									<a href="images/m5/heatmap-5019308-click-phone.jpg" target="_blank">Click heatmap for phone</a>
									</p>
	
									<p>A move map tracks where visitors move their mouse on the screen as they go through the page; the longer the mouse cursor stays over a certain point, the hotter it becomes. <br>
									<a href="images/m5/heatmap-5019308-movement-desktop.jpg" target="_blank">Movement for desktop</a>
									</p>

									<p>
									Looking at the scroll heatmap we can tell that not all the users had enough patience to see all the content of the landing page, but almost all of them manage to see the part in which they can leave their contact.
									<br>
									<a href="images/m5/heatmap-5019308-scroll-desktop.jpg" target="_blank">Scroll for desktop </a>
									<br>
									<a href="images/m5/heatmap-5019308-scroll-phone.jpg" target="_blank">Scroll for phone </a>

								<h3>3. Promoting the landing page</h3>
									<p>One of our best surprises came from abroad. Taylor, a guy who visited our landing page, used our email address from the description and send us his thoughts through an e-mail:

									</p>
								
									In order to bring people to BookaBook landing page, we approached different methods:<br>
									- Creating a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Book-a-Book-110898800379207/">Facebook page </a> and inviting our friends to visit it and hit like<br>
									- We shared our page on Facebook (groups, story and profile), Instagram, Twitter <br>

							<h3>3. Conclusions</h3>	
								We started to promote our landing page since 10th November 2019 on different social media platforms and succeeded to attract over 200 people from Romania and abroad.
								Facebook was our main source of advertising through posts and our Facebook page (in its first day - 23 November, over 110 liked were collected).
								<img src="images/m5/facebook.png" width="95%" >

								<br>
								Looking at Hotjar we came to the conclusion that on the landing page 48.8% scrolled all the length of the page on mobile and 58.5% on laptops/ computers. This can tell us that we should arrange the site differently so everyone can see the main information like the contact right from the beginning.
								<br>
								Unfortunately, not all the people who entered our site were interested enough to leave their email account, but this is understandable because of the email spam. In the future, we can try and make pages on Instagram, Twitter and try to post everyday updates of our project.

							<h2 class="major" >Milestone 6 - Market Research </h2>
							
							<h2>Size of the Target Market</h2>
							
								In the beginning, our application will target the avid readers of Bucharest city. 
								By avid readers we are referring to people that are reading at least one book a month. 
								An estimate approximation of that will be around 10 to 20 percent of young to middle adults, approximately 5 to 10 percent of all people.
								The population of Bucharest has approximative 2 million people, so the size of our initial target market will be around <b> 90 to 200 thousand </b> people.
								<br>
								If we are doing fine on the initial market we can extend our services to all the people in Romania (approximately 20 million people), which will result in a market of <b>1 to 2 million </b> people.

							<br>
							<br>
							<h2>Competitors</h2>
								
								We found <b>1 competitor</b> that has a monopol over the market segment that we are targeting:
								<br>
								<img src="images/m6/bookster.png" width="20%" >
								<h3 class="font-weight-bold mt-4 mb-3">Bookster</h3>
								<p class="grey-text">The first modern public library in Romania. Bookster now delivers books and articles to over 30,000 readers from the biggest 200 companies in Romania.
										That’s about 20% market share in the corporate sector. In many industries, it is already a standard employee benefit. 
									In 2016, Bookster had 50,000 books in the library and it reached break-even with 1 million EUR in income.
								</p>


								Targeting the people who love to read, we can also try to target the people who currently buy books from the bookstores, or use physical or only libraries to rent books.
								
								<br>
								<br>
								In Romania we also have many bookstores: <br>
								- <b>librarie.net</b>  <br>
								- <b> emag.ro</b>  <br>
								- <b>librex.ro </b> <br>
								- <b>books-express.ro </b> <br>
								- <b>librarieonline.ro </b> <br>

								<br>
								We found multiple online libraries:<br>
								- <b>Open library </b>- is an open, editable library catalog, building towards a web page for every book ever published. <br>
								- <b>Project Gutenberg </b>- is a library of over 60,000 free eBooks. Choose among free epub and Kindle eBooks, download them or read them online.<br>
								- <b>The free library </b>-  is an invaluable research tool and the fastest, easiest way to locate useful information on virtually any topic. <br>
								- <b>Public Booksheft </b>- the goal of the PublicBookshelf Corporation is to bring together quality authors and open-minded readers in a controlled environment where an exchange of ideas, creativity, and knowledge can happen.<br>
								- <b>Bookrix </b>- is a free self publishing platform that offers eBook distribution services to independent writers. Their users can share their writing, connect with other readers, and discover new books and authors – all in one place.<br>						 
							<br>
							<br>
							<h2>Customer Solution, Businesses Solution, What we bring new?</h2>
							For the part of renting books the competitors on the current market in Bucharest are most of the libraries, but there are offering a limited number of books, most of which are only old titles and also, most of them don’t have an online platform or a method to deliver the books. 
							These are the best for people that want to read books, but don’t want to own any.
							<br>
							<br>
							On the other hand we have another big company that recently started to rent books for individuals. 
							This company is called Bookster and you can rent books for free, but you have to take them from their headquarters which is located near the Aviatorilor metro station (good location, but not the best for every Bucharest citizen). 
							This is perfect for people that have time or can go fast to their headquarters and also would want to see what books they can change from before losing their time going there. 
							Bookster also have paid partnerships with companies. They offer books and transport for them directly to their offices.
							<br>
							<br>
							For the part of book delivery we have lots of local online stores (Emag, Elefant, Carturesti...), but none of these stores have any service for renting books. 
							This is the best appropriate for people who don’t want to lose a lot of time searching for books and also going to a physical bookstore and buying them. 
							Most of them may also want to rent the books, but don’t have the time to take them in person.
							<br>
							<br>
							As we can see, all of our competitors are only covering a part of what we want to offer, but not all of it. 
							We are offering both of these words(letting you rent a book and have it delivered to your door). 
							By this, we can say that with our product we are targeting all the markets presented before.

							<br>
							<br>
							<h2>Potential Market Share in first 5 Years</h2>
								<img src="images/m6/marketSize.png" width="95%" >
								<img src="images/m6/marketSize2.png" width="95%" >
							<br>
							<br>

							<h2>Market Value in first 5 Years</h2>
								Nowadays, our competitor is Bookster has 100.000 readers (1000 companies). The company pays approximately 28 lei/ person for access to Bookster.<br>
								<br>
								Book a Book is proposing to charge 25 lei per user. In the first year, in order to attract the users, Book a Book is planning to have a special offer to receive books instead of payment. 
								<br>
								Obviously, the total market value will have a different value every year.
