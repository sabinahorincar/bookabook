								<h2 class="major">Milestone 1 - Description</h2>
								<h3>The problem</h3>
								<p>Romanian editors are consistently complaining about the fact that the book market is very low, being placed the last in Europe, behind smaller countries like Hungary or the Czech Republic. Romanians neither buy nor read many books. In fact, these two are completely different things, although the polls show otherwise, considering the low number of visitors in public libraries.
								<br>One of the reasons may be the things that people enjoy buying better than books. Time is another similar reason, as it is never enough, especially when buying books or reading are not on the top of the priorities list.</p>
							
								<h3>Book a Book is a solution</h3>
								<p>Our idea represents a solution to these problems: an online library that enables any user to place him/herself only at a click away from a book ready to be read.
								<br>The cost related issue may be solved by simply donating books for a monthly membership. As long as the membership is active, the user can borrow any book, and this will help our library grow.
								<br>Another option for those who can not be apart from their books is to pay for the membership. For starters, we will promote the first option as much as possible because it serves our purpose: to grow the number and diversity of our books.</p>	
								
								<h3>Our target customers</h3>
								<p>Nowadays, the reading is either of electronic devices (mobile phones, e-readers, computer displays) or of the printed word from ink such as books, magazines or newspapers.
								<br> Book a Book is a project targeting people who have a passion for reading. The clients for this application are the people who wish to read but they don’t have time to go and search for the desired book and want to have the book delivered at their doors.</p>
							
								<h3>Our competition</h3>
								The 3 big competitors for Book a Book are:
								<ul>
									<li> <a href="https://www.booklender.com/"> Booklender </a>who offers the possibility of renting a number of books for a membership paid monthly (the more expensive the membership the more number of books you can have at one time)</li>
									<li> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/"> Amazon </a> who offers the possibility of renting a book for a fixed price dependent on the desired book</li>
									<li> <a href="https://www.bookster.ro/landing/"> Bookster </a> who is focused for the corporations, helping their employees to rent a book and have it at the company headquarters once a week</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Why us ? Our advantage over the competition</h3>
								<p>In comparison with all these companies, Book a Book offers you the possibility to rent a book by having a monthly membership or by giving a book of your own and we will also bring the book to your door because we understand how important your time is.</p>
								
								<h3>Key metrics</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Daily, weekly, or monthly active users on application or website (DAU/WAU/MAU)</li>
									<li>Average time spent on your website</li>
									<li>Returning visitors to application or website</li>
									<li>User satisfaction</li>
									<li>Average revenue per account</li>
									<li>Number of logins</li>
									<li>Monthly recurring revenue</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Cost structure</h3>
								<p>Our startup has both variable and fixed costs.
								<br>In the fixed costs category we can find the salaries for our employees, the bank and legal charges, the software, the server and the domain name acquisition.
								<br>In the variable costs category we can identify the advertising and promotions, the delivery services of the books and the books replacement in case of destroying.
								</p>

								<h3>Revenue streams</h3>
								In this company the revenue will come from 3 income streams:
								<ul>
									<li>Monthly paid membership (which is the main income stream that we’ll have)</li>
									<li>Ads for the people which don’t have paid membership and are renting books by giving one in return(most ads we’ll be related with books and maybe some of them will be partnerships with some audio books websites)</li>
								</ul>

								<h2 class="major">Milestone 2 - Validation</h2>
								<h3>Identification of the problem</h3>
								<p> According to a <a href="https://pedagoteca.ro/studiu-jumatate-dintre-romani-nu-au-citit/"> study </a> from Romania, over half of the people in 2016 haven’t read any book. Knowledge is power: we believe that with our idea, people can be encouraged to improve themselves and read more.</p>
								
								<h3>Our solution</h3>
								<p>Considering all the possibilities that would have an impact on society, we thought of something innovative which would motivate people to improve themselves by reading. Taking into consideration our survey, most of them had a “time difficulty”. Book a Book can help the ones who don’t want to waste time by going to the library, searching for a book in stores or staying in queues to buy books. With our application, we believe that people would be more motivated to read more.</p>
							
								<h3>Our plan for customer discovery</h3>
								<p> We decided that we would gather our information from interviews and an online form. We wanted to reach a larger variety of people and we figured that an online form was the best and most efficient way to do it. We established a set of questions and then spread the form on multiple facebook groups and amongst some of our friends. In this way people of different ages and different domains of activity would fill it.</p>
								
								<h3>Description of the process</h3>
								<p>We collected information using online questionnaires and having face-to-face interviews. Over 160 people responded to our online survey and the age range of the ones who responded is between 18 and 53 years old. Even though 53 is the highest age that responded to our survey, talking face to face with some people over 58 who were kind enough to talk to us we discovered that they might be interested in our application. After the interviews, we realised that the application might interest a larger segment of people, the people who know how to browse the internet or who know own and know how to use a smartphone and like to read (probably not older that 65-70 years old).</p>
								Our survey questions were the following:
								<ul>
									<li>What age are you? (Write a number representing years)​</li>
									<li>Which is your professional field​?</li>
									<li>Do you read regularly?​​</li>
									<li>​How much do you read on average per week?​</li>
									<li>What kind of books do you enjoy reading?​</li>
									<li>What is your biggest setback when it comes to reading?​</li>
									<li>Do you think that having the possibility to exchange an old book of yours with a new one would help you read more often?​</li>
									<li>Do you have among your personal books some which you are willing to offer in exchange for a membership?​</li>
									<li>How much are you willing to pay on a monthly online library access which is also home delivering your books?​</li>								
								</ul>

								<h3>Description of how these insights affects our product</h3>
								<p>The next conclusions have been drawn from the form completed by over 160 people:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>We can cover a vast segment including various ages, but this did not surprise us, considering that reading applies to any age. Taking into consideration the fact that young people are more active online than the others, we concluded that for now, we should focus on people that are not more than 30.</li>
									<img src="images/m2/age.png" >
									<br>X axe - age, Y axe - number of users
									
									<li>Regarding the professional field, we have been glad to learn that our form have reached to people from various domains of activity. From our stats derives the observation that there are engineers, doctors, teachers, and students who have shown interest for an online library.</li>
									<img src="images/m2/occupation.png" >
									
									<li>76 % of the participants to this study have affirmed that they read on a daily basis, and 51 % have said they read 1 to 4 hours a week. This make us believe that there will be a continuum of borrowings monthly.</li>
									<img src="images/m2/read-week.png" >

									<li>Regarding the literary preferences, they vary and can be identified below.</li>
									<img src="images/m2/book-type.png" >

									<li>96 % said time is the greatest factor against reading. We believe that us delivering the books they like to the location of their choice will help them.</li>
									<img src="images/m2/setback.png" >

									<li>We have also seen some sort of encouragement in the answers related to the idea of exchanging books. More than half of them think that a borrow- exchange type of activity would help them read more. 64% are willing to offer books for a monthly access, which makes us have faith in our idea.</li>
									<img src="images/m2/exchange-book.png" >

									<li>If 64 % of the participants to this study are willing to offer books in exchange for access, from our stats, the rest are willing to pay for it.</li>
									<img src="images/m2/pay-month.png" >
								</ol>

								<h3>Are we ready to move to the Customer Validation stage?</h3>
								<p>Taking into account the fact that 51% of the people who took the survey were willing to exchange an old book for a new one, 64% agreed to offering an old book for a membership and that 78% were willing to pay a monthly subscription, we think that we are ready to take this to the next step, Customer Validation.</p>
